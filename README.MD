# Bingo Creator

### Origin
Bingo Creator is a small tool for generating buzzword bingos on the command line. It was originally created for the Eurovision Song Contest but can be used with any kind of buzzwords or stereotypical events.

### Usage
```
java net.tobiaskohl.bingocreator.BingoCreator [n] [l] [b] [c] [o]
[n]: The number of Bingo sheets needed
[l]: The textfile containing the field entries, one per line. At least 24, but any larger number is possible
[b]: The background image file
[c]: The file containing the image to be displayed on the joker field in the center
[o]: The output filename
```
It might be necessary to put the individual arguments in ""

### Thanks
Great thanks to Verena (http://www.verenas-welt.com) for providing me with a design vision of how the finalized Bingo sheet should look :)
